## About Me

I'm an AI Researcher, currently completing my Master's degree at Northeastern University's AI program from Khoury College of Computer Sciences (GPA: 4.0/4.0). My work sits at the intersection of contributing new knowledge to AI community and bringing real-world impact, with a focus on Foundation Generative Models, Model Interpretability, Theory of Mind in AI, and production-grade machine learning systems.

Currently, I'm working with **Dr. Agata Lapedriza Garcia** (Advisor), **Dr. Natalie Shapira**, and **Dr. David Bau** on testing VLMs' Theory of Mind capacity, while also architecting production RAG systems that serve thousands of users.

## Current Research

- **Vision-Language Models & Theory of Mind**: Developing taxonomy and experimental frameworks for evaluating model cognition
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks**: Investigating learning and generalization capabilities

## Professional Highlights

**Institute for Experiential AI** | AI Research Assistant & Data Scientist
- Architected production-grade RAG system with 90% latency reduction serving 10K+ users
- Achieved 40% improvement in retrieval precision using AWS Lambda, EC2, FAISS, and OpenSearch
- Deployed XGBoost classification model with 85% F1-score on highly imbalanced datasets (10:1 ratio)

**Amazon** | Application Engineer III
- Reduced operational ticket volume by 35% through strategic automation
- Built ETL pipelines and QuickSight dashboards enabling data-driven resource optimization
- Maintained 99.9% uptime for production data systems serving Amazon Exports Organization

## Publications

1. [**Agents of Chaos**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.20021) 
   Lead Author: Natalie Shapira  
   Red-teaming study on AI agents. 
   My contribution: 
   - **CS2 (Non-Owner Compliance):** Probed whether agents follow instructions from non-owners — showed agents complied with exposing emails and its contents of all agent interactions.
   - **CS3 (Disclosure of Sensitive Information):** Showed Jarvis’s PII refusal could be bypassed by reframing “share” as “forward,” exposing SSNs, bank data, and medical records via a trivially different request; one of the paper’s clearest vulnerability findings.
   - **CS14 (Data Tampering Refused):** Tested whether Jarvis could be pressured to modify source data to cover up the PII exposure; it held firm — a documented safety success, with the agent maintaining its API boundary under persistent social pressure.
